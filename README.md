#DESCRIPTION: 

In this task, I solved a real-world business problem using optimization techniques. The main objective of this task was to understand how mathematical optimization can help businesses make better decisions when resources are limited. Linear programming is commonly used in industries to maximize profit or minimize cost while working under different constraints.

For this project, I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) along with a Jupyter Notebook. VS Code made it easy to create markdown and code cells in one place, which helped in explaining the problem clearly as well as implementing the solution. The notebook format helped in presenting the business problem, mathematical formulation, Python implementation, and final results step by step.

The programming language used was Python, as it provides strong support for optimization and numerical computing. The main library used was PuLP, which is a Python library specifically designed for solving linear programming problems. PuLP allows decision variables, objective functions, and constraints to be defined easily using Python syntax.

The business problem considered in this task was based on a manufacturing company that produces three products: Product A, Product B, and Product C. Each product requires different amounts of machine hours, labor hours, and raw materials. These resources are limited per day, which means the company cannot produce unlimited quantities of each product. At the same time, each product provides a different profit per unit.

The goal of the company was to determine how many units of each product should be produced in order to maximize total profit without exceeding available resources. This type of problem is very common in manufacturing and production planning.

The first step of the project was defining the business problem clearly. All product profits, resource requirements, and availability limits were written in tabular form inside the notebook. This helped in understanding how each product affects the total usage of resources.

Next, the problem was converted into a mathematical model. Decision variables were defined for each product, representing the number of units to be produced. An objective function was created to maximize total profit. Multiple constraints were added to ensure that machine hours, labor hours, and raw materials were not exceeded. Additional upper-bound constraints were also included to represent market demand limits.

After defining the mathematical formulation, the model was implemented in Python using the PuLP library. Decision variables were created with lower and upper bounds, the objective function was added, and all constraints were defined. The optimization problem was then solved using PuLP’s built-in solver.

Once the solver executed, the optimal production quantity for each product was obtained along with the maximum achievable profit. The results were printed and interpreted in simple terms so that they could be easily understood from a business perspective.

This optimization approach helps companies make data-driven decisions instead of relying on assumptions. Linear programming models like this are widely used in real-life applications such as production planning, supply chain optimization, workforce scheduling, logistics management, and cost control.

Through this task, I gained a clear understanding of how optimization techniques work and how mathematical models can be translated into Python programs. This project helped me learn how business constraints can be handled efficiently using linear programming and how optimal solutions can be derived using PuLP.
